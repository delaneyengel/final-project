      <h1>From the Locker Room to the Barracks to the Brain</h1>
      <h2>An Inside Perspective on the Life of a Midshipman Student Athlete</h2>
      <h3>Delaney Engel, December 2, 2021</h3>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <p>
        A Midshipman at the United States Naval Academy adopts the values of
        Honor, Courage and Commitment when dressed in their Parade Blues jacket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Uniforms possess a different meaning to every person who wears one. To
        Gabriel ‘Gabe’ Craven a uniform represents an earned accomplishment.
        Craven has earned many uniforms throughout his life. Even though the
        Midshipman and athlete has received praise throughout his career, he
        never expected to endure internal struggles. As he finishes his first of
        a nine year commitment with the Navy, Craven begins to question his
        abilities and purpose. Despite the rigid front, even the most confident
        can put forth a facade.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craven started playing hockey at a young age and wore various jerseys.
        From there, Craven developed a strong love for lacrosse when he was only
        in second grade.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Just like all the other kids, my parents wanted me to try every sport,
        and I gave lacrosse a shot,” Craven explained. “I started getting pretty
        good, and I was still very young at the time… I basically fell in love
        with the game.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Growing up in Monroe Township, New Jersey and after many years of
        playing lacrosse both recreationally and competitively on various
        academy and club teams, the Under Armour All American third ranked
        goalie in the country knew the sport was his passion and would be a path
        he would continue to pursue for the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gabe is one of the best goalies I have ever shared the field with,”
        Quentin Pellegrino, Craven’s teammate from the 2019 Under Armour
        Underclass All-American Tournament expressed.

        Before even playing a single minute of a high school lacrosse game,
        Craven committed to the United States Naval Academy to pursue both his
        athletic and academic career as a Midshipman at only 15 years old, he
        shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I really just fell in love with Navy because of the challenges and
        opportunities it presented,” Craven explained. “I talked to a lot of
        different schools, and it just seemed like the right fit.”

                }
            }
          });
        })();
      </script>
      <p>
        The new Navy recruit was excited and optimistic for his future ahead of
        him as a student athlete at one of the most prestigious academies in the
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craven thoroughly explained the rigorous Naval Academy lifestyle as his
        days are filled with structure, discipline and endless hours of hard
        work and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from a full day of challenging academic courses such as chemistry,
        physics and thermodynamics, the Midshipman has to participate in
        parades, which include live trades, lineups and mandatory lectures he
        must attend while still managing a heavy schedule as being an athlete as
        well, Craven shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the workload at the academy may seem only a physical challenge,
        the highly regimented, stern atmosphere has established internal
        struggles for Craven, especially on the lacrosse field, an environment
        he had always thrived in, Craven revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It's really hard,” Craven said. “This year I did not play well... I
        didn't even get to dress for most games...It was really stressful for
        me. Not playing, and not being able to go to games was a situation I've
        never been in before, and I didn't expect to be in and I wasn't prepared
        to be in. It really, really hurt and it was a real struggle, mentally
        and physically.”

                    t[r].style.height = e.data["datawrapper-height"][a] + "px";

      <p>
        Despite all the physical and mental hardships Craven endured throughout
        his freshman year, including a global pandemic, he had to continue to
        keep his brave face and conceal his true inner feelings behind his
        various uniforms, hiding his internal thoughts and emotions from many.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craven shared that one of the hardest days of the 2021 lacrosse season
        was the game against Army, a highly publicized and traditionalized event
        that created an intense atmosphere for all, ultimately leading Craven to
        question if Navy truly was the right place for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There is a lot of hype around the game,” Craven said. “When we beat
        them it was really fun, and awesome. It is beautiful seeing the seniors
        demotion but, you know, I was angry because I didn't get to play.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In Annapolis, on April 24, the event of the Army vs. Navy game filled
        the Navy–Marine Corps Memorial Stadium with parent spectators, alumni,
        staff, and students.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rivalry between the two schools and the historical significance
        behind it presented a day full of emotions for all, but especially for
        Craven, who observed from the sidelines, never experiencing a sense of
        defeat like he had that day ever before.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I was embarrassed, actually, because there's 5000 people there and a
        lot of my classmates were there and I didn't even get to dress. It's a
        small school so people kind of know who you are and especially in
        sports,” Craven shared. “This is such an alpha school, everybody cares
        about sports, so when you come in with a lot of expectations and you
        don't quite live up to them it’s embarrassing and I was really upset.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Ian Franzoni, Craven’s teammate from The Hun School of Princeton,
        sympathizes with Craven as the football player explained that he had
        endured hardships as well throughout his freshman year at Brown
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you’re used to playing so much, sometimes you may take it for
        granted,” Franzoni explained. “When it gets taken away from you, it is
        like a shot to the heart.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Franzoni uniquely understands Craven’s perspective and can connect to
        him and the immense pressure prestigious universities, both Navy and
        Brown, can project onto their students, especially athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I love Gabe,” his friend shared. “He’s just an awesome kid and always
        has a ton of positive energy so seeing him struggle this year has been
        tough.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Wendy Craven, Gabe’s mother, explained how she has encouraged her son to
        have a new and refreshed outlook on this new chapter of his life, which
        has presented him more of a challenge than he intended it to.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When you get to college, things change because you no longer have
        parents, teachers, coaches, a whole bunch of adults being your
        cheerleaders and validating you and your successes,” Craven’s mom
        addressed. “When you get to college, you're on your own and the
        motivation has to come from internal validation...It just has to come
        from within.”

                }
            }
          });
        })();
      </script>
      <p>
        Mirroring the words of his wife, Craven’s father Scott had similar
        advice for his son and the challenges he has encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everything has to be about yourself, motivating yourself about creating
        your own schedule and your own path, and that's that that's the biggest
        thing, even at the highly disciplined military,” Craven’s father guided.
        “You have to motivate yourself.”

      <p>
        The Midshipman unveiled how being at the Naval Academy has been a
        significant internal struggle and shift from his previous preliminary
        childhood and high school athletic life where he was always the star of
        the game, always saving the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Craven disclosed that it has been a personal struggle to reshape his
        mindset, and essentially redefine what his uniforms meant to him for the
        new chapter of his life, but assured that he will continue to motivate
        himself and always recognize his own hard work and self-worth at the end
        of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Everyone always thinks things as a prestigious student athlete is all
        rainbows...I think the more important thing is to kind of focus on the
        day to day here.”
